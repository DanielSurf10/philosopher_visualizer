## Introduction
The dining philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science. It illustrates the challenges of resource allocation and deadlock avoidance in concurrent systems. This project aims to visualize the problem using a graphical interface, making it easier to understand and analyze.

## Installation
To install and run the Philosopher Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/philosopher_visualizer.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd philosopher_visualizer`
3. Install the required dependencies for Python: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
To start the Philosopher Visualizer, run the following command:

```
python3 philosophers_visualizer/main.py
```

This will launch the graphical interface, where you can observe the dining philosophers problem in action. You can interact with the interface to change the number of philosophers, adjust the speed of the simulation, and visualize different strategies for solving the problem.
